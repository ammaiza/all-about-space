	<h3>Moon Profile</h3>
	<br>
	<p>orbit: 384,400 km from earth</p>
	<p>diameter: 3476 km</p>
	<p>mass: 7.35e22 kg</p>
	<br>
	<h4>History</h4>
	<div>Called Luna by the Romans, Selene and Artemis by the Greeks, and many other names in other mythologies. 
The Moon, of course, has been known for a long time. It is the second brightest object in the sky after the Sun. Although, it doesn't actually have any light. It only reflects the light of the sun. Due to its size and composition, the Moon is sometimes classified as a terrestrial "planet" along with Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.</div>
    <br>
     <div>The Moon was first visited by the Soviet spacecraft Luna 2 in 1959. It is the only extraterrestrial body to have been visited by humans(But Mars is catching up too). The first landing was on July 20, 1969 and the last was in December 1972. The Moon is also the only body from which samples have been returned to Earth. And yes, we did land on the moon. I absolutely disagree with the moon hoax.</div>

	 <br>
	<div>The moon's gravitational forces create a lot of effects, tides being the main one. The sun and moon's gravity together lift water up from the earth. But tides aren't the only effect. We might not be able to feel it but the moon is actually making the earth tilt causing it slow down. The moon is also getting away from the earth about 4cm from the earth. (Unless you're reading this in the 23rd century you have nothing to worry about.) </div>
    <div>The Moon has no atmosphere. But evidence from Clementine suggested that there may be water ice in some deep craters near the Moon's south pole which are permanently shaded. This has now been reinforced by data from Lunar Prospector. There is apparently ice at the north pole as well. Luna Prospector and Clementine are two satellites that study the moon. </div>	
	<h2>Pluto</h2>
	<br>
	<div>Pluto orbits beyond the orbit of Neptune (usually). It is much smaller than any of the official planets and now classified as a "dwarf planet". Pluto is smaller than seven of the solar system's moons (the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan and Triton).</div>

	<h3>Pluto Profile</h3>
	<br>
	<p>orbit: 5,913,520,000 km from the Sun</p>
	<p>diameter: 2372 km</p>
	<p>mass: 1.303e22 kg</p>
	<br>
	<h4>History<h4>
	<div>Pluto was discovered in 1930. Calculations which later turned out to be in error had predicted a planet beyond Neptune, based on the motions of Uranus and Neptune. Not knowing of the error, Clyde W. Tombaugh at Lowell Observatory in Arizona did a very careful sky survey which turned up to be Pluto. So it was all a fortunate accident. Did you know that potato chips are accidents too? They were invented when a famous chef cut his fries too thin and overcooked them. </div>
	<br>
	<div>Pluto has five moons:  Charon, Hydra, Nix, Kerberos, Styx.</div>
